# HCUTCL

Everyone in the hackclub slack uses one thing : custom emojis. Kind of like a language that universal among hackclubbers. So i thought i would also make it into a programming language :)

## Plans

This started as just a brainfuck substitution (it still is for now), but it's gonna be more than that :
- [x] Uses a slack bot as it's interface
- [x] Uses Hackclub's emojis
- [ ] Custom Interpreter in Python, Not from a translation to Brainfuck but directly in HCUTCL
- [ ] (Maybe) API for the compiler/interpreter ?
- [ ] Custom `.` from brainfuck alternative
  - [ ] Different Emojis for 2 Variants : Output in ASCII, Hex? or Number
- [ ] Input : use 2 Emojis to Open and close the input.
